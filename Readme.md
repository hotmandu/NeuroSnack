==========

*계획 구상 단계*

What is this?
-------------

A network model designer & visualizer for Beginners.

You can model a simple network, train it, see the intermediate results, etc...

How this will look like?
------------------------

Visualizer like [this](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron)

Maybe connect nodes like [Blueprints in Unreal](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/Blueprints/GettingStarted/index.html)

Features
--------

(May not be implemented due to technical problems)
- Model structure optimizer (Spread layer detection?)
- Highly flexible (Connecting math functions)
- Visualization of training, each node
- Easy to use, still great performance (may sacrifice performance to put more 'interactivity')
